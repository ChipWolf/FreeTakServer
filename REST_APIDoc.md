# FreeTAKServer REST API Documentation
the FreeTAKServer REST API is a human readeble approach to the TAK world. The API allows you to easily connect third parties to the TAK family, without the need to understand the complexity of the COT structure or what a TCP connection is.  FTS also supports an [Internal API](REST_API_InternalDoc.md).
WARNING: the current document contains experimental, not yet released functions (listed)

## List of supported API
In the current release (1.5), FTS supports following API:
  * ManageGeoEvent
  * ManageChat
  * ManageEmergency
  * ManagePresence
  
## General Configuration
> To quickly test the API, you can use a browser extension (Chrome) like ARC Advanced rest client.REST APIs are easy to use, however they require a minimum ammount of knowledge, we DO NOT provide support to explain WHAT an API is. Please refer to an online tutorial such as [this](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/using-http-apis-for-iot-beginners-guide/). 

### endpoint
the API uses the following format

VERB [Protocol]://IP:PORT/APIName/action

for example
```
POST http://104.58.20.216:9999/manageGeoObject/postGeoObject
```

### Authorization
to use the API you need to have a REST API key.
the authorization is placed in the header of the message.
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]

> you need to use the string 'Bearer' before YOUR_API_KEY

a valid key is generated from FTS' [CLI](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/blob/main/docs/docs/CLI.md) or, since 1.4 also from the Web UI, and stored into the DB. 
to add an API user in the CLI type  
```
add_api_user
```
see CLI help for details.
To create a REST API key using the Web UI, go to the User section.

to consume the API you will need to request a key to your FTS admin. 

the following is a non-working example of a key
```
{“Authorization”: “Bearer meg@secre7apip@guesmeIfyouCan”}
```

### Message
the message is placed in the body of the request as JSON formatted. See below for detailed examples.

## API Details
### manageGeoObject 
a GeoObject is an element place on a map. It has a name, characteristics and an attitude. 

#### postGeoObject

* verb: POST
* endPoint: /ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject
* returns: UID
 
#### Parameters
* GeoObject: It's the information that will determine which type will be placed on the tak maps including his icon. Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries. Since 1.7 you can also use nicknames for the geo objects.
*  longitude: the angular distance of the geoobject from the meridian of the greenwich, UK expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g -76.107.7998).  remember to set the display of your TAK in decimal cohordinates, where *West 77.08* is equal to '-77.08' in the API
* latitude: the angular distance of the geoobject from the earths equator expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g 43.855682)
* How: the way in which this geo information has been acquired. Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries.
* attitude: the kind of expected behavior of the GeoObject (e.g friendly, hostile, unknown). Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries.
* name: a string to ID the GeoObject on a map.
* bearing: since 1.7, the direction expressed in degrees (1-360)   
* distance": since 1.7, the distance in meters from the Lat/long 
* timeout:the length, expressed in seconds  until the point will stale out. Default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
*  uid: optional input parameter, need to be an Unique Id for this element, if not present will be  server generated, if sent ATAK will try to update an existing geoObject. Use ``putGeoObject`` instead
